# Coeus Game Engine

3D game engine in pure LuaJIT with a focus on fast development and high quality games. Check out the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B1VFdVDpTS-sa3hmNlhieEt6dUk) for documentation.

Binaries for Windows (32-bit) are included in the lib/win32 folder. You'll still need a LuaJIT install with LuaSocket and LuaFileSystem, however.
