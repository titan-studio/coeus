# Coeus Game Engine

3D game engine in pure LuaJIT with a focus on fast development and high quality games. Official IRC is at #coeus on irc.oftc.net.

Binaries for Windows (32-bit) are included in the lib/win32 folder. They were built with Visual Studio 2013. You'll still need a LuaJIT install with LuaSocket and LuaFileSystem, however, and it might need to be built with Visual Studio as well.
